# Snapshots
Users will have the ability to manage snapshots for each VM.

### View Snapshots
Within the details page, the user will be able to see a card that lists all of the snapshots for the VM.

### Delete Snapshot(s)
Deleting a snapshot should give the user a confirmation dialog. In some cases, other dependent snapshots would be deleted as well and this should be clear to the user.
